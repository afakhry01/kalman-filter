# Kalman Filter in Autonomous Vehicles
This project simulates an autonomous delivery robot that uses `Kalman Filter` to filter out noises in Lidar readings. Based on these data, the robot can detect pedestrians location and find its way to the delivery point while avoiding pedestrians.

## How to run
In progress

## TODO List
- [X] Build Kalman Filter
- [X] Implement pedestrians, autonomous vehicle and lidar
- [ ] Create simulation ui
- [ ] Add streamlit interface
